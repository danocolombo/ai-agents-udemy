My name is Dano Colombo. I have worked in the IT industry since 1983, starting at Hewlett Packard in California working with spectrum analyzers, then in 1988 I transfered to Boise, Idaho where I worked on storage devices and in got my software career started. I worked as a system administrator on HP-UX and writing software to modernize the standard production line. Implementing real-time operator instructions and just in time (JIT) inventory management.  This involved C programming, sockets and SQL integration with Informix databases.
I moved to the LaserJet organizing in the mid '90s where I was able to become one of the leaders in the softare quality assurance organization. After a couple years I took my software skills to the LaserJet Hardware Quality Assurance department were I converted many proceses from paper and notebooks to an online management system. This involved writing cgi scripts and Visual Basic interfaces to the Microsoft Access datbase.
I have done some AI development using OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI open-source framework, and learning LangGraph and AutoGen.
