**Motion: There needs to be strict laws to regulate Large Language Models (LLMs)**

Ladies and gentlemen, I stand firmly in support of this motion, and I urge you to consider the following argument carefully.

We are living in a moment of extraordinary technological change. Large Language Models — AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and others — are becoming deeply embedded in our daily lives. They write our emails, assist in medical decisions, generate legal documents, create news articles, and influence public opinion. And yet, there is virtually **no binding legal framework** governing how they must behave, who is responsible when they cause harm, or what limits they must respect. That is not just an oversight — it is a danger.

**First, LLMs can cause real, measurable harm without accountability.**
These systems can generate misinformation at scale, produce deepfake content, assist in cyberattacks, or provide dangerous medical and legal advice to vulnerable people. Right now, when someone is harmed by an LLM's output, there is no clear legal path to justice. Strict laws would establish accountability — making it clear who is responsible when things go wrong: the developer, the deployer, or the platform.

**Second, without regulation, the most powerful technology of our era will be shaped purely by profit motives.**
Companies will race to deploy the most capable systems as fast as possible, cutting corners on safety to beat competitors. We have seen this story before with social media — and we are still dealing with the consequences. Regulation is not the enemy of innovation; it is the guardrail that ensures innovation does not destroy what it was meant to improve.

**Third, LLMs threaten democratic integrity and human dignity.**
These systems can be used to generate billions of convincing fake messages, manipulate elections, spread propaganda, and erode trust in institutions. Without strict laws mandating transparency — such as labeling AI-generated content, requiring bias audits, and limiting certain use cases — we are handing bad actors a weapon with no defense.

**Fourth, strict laws already exist for far less powerful technologies.**
We regulate pharmaceuticals before they reach patients. We regulate cars before they hit the road. We require aircraft to meet safety standards before they carry passengers. Why would we treat a technology capable of influencing millions of minds as though it deserves *less* scrutiny than a seatbelt? The argument that LLMs are "just tools" ignores their unprecedented scale and influence.

**The solution is not to stifle innovation — it is to direct it responsibly.**
Strict laws can require transparency in training data, mandate human oversight in high-stakes decisions, establish independent auditing bodies, and create clear liability frameworks. This protects citizens, builds public trust, and ultimately creates a healthier environment for AI to flourish — responsibly.

The question is not whether we *can* regulate LLMs. The question is whether we have the courage to do so before the harms become irreversible.

**I strongly support this motion. The time for strict regulation of LLMs is not tomorrow — it is now.**
